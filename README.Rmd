># Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

* This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
  The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:
    + Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
    + Load the activity and feature information
    + Load the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which
      reflect a mean or standard deviation
    + Load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those
      columns with the dataset
    + Merge the two datasets
    + Convert the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors
    + Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
      variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
